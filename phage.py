    For each occupied cell in grid.grid, compute two independent
    adsorption attempts—one for phage_A vs. channels_A, one for phage_B vs. channels_B—
    regardless of any 'type' field on the bacterium. If both phage types “win” in this
    timestep, choose one at random to actually infect.

    Each adsorption probability is computed as:
        p0_A = PHAGE_A_ADSORPTION_RATE * local_phA
        nA = bacterium.channels_A
        p_infectA = 1 - (1 - clamp(p0_A,0,1))^nA

        p_infectB = 1 - (1 - clamp(p0_B,0,1))^nB

    If either succeeds, schedule that infection (with the corresponding latent period).
    If both succeed, pick A or B with equal chance.
